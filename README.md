### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I made a decision a year ago to pivot my career path and become a dev. 
Here on my GitHub you will find everthing I've been working on and learning. 

I am currently learning ReactJS and working on projects. They will be added to my portfolio soon. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a React Cat Fact Generator. Using an API and useState to display the facts.

</br>

ðŸŒ± I am a Junior Developer currently learning the following technologies;

<li>ReactJS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Semantic HTML</li>
<li>CSS/SCSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
